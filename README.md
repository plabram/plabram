### Hello, world 🌏

There are not many areas of digital products I haven't touched over the years.

I started my career in Product Management, specialising in data analysis (PostgreSQL, R). 

Then I caught the coding bug, and retrained as a MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) engineer. I'm happiest when my hands are dirty and I'm making things 🛠️

Currently, I'm a full stack software developer. Mostly web, although I flirt with SwiftUI in my spare time 💻📱

As well as tech, I know a lot about "the business" (whatever that means).
