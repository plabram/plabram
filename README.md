Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer who builds end-to-end solutions. My main tools are JavaScript across both the frontend and backend (#NodeJS, #Express, #React), along with experience in databases like #PostgreSQL and #MongoDB. Iâ€™ve also dabbled in mobile development using #ReactNative and #SwiftUI, and have hands-on experience with CI/CD (#GitHub, #Docker).

My background is a little different-I studied formal logic as part of a Philosophy degree. Those problem-solving skills have been key to my journey as a self-taught developer, and Iâ€™m always up for learning something new.

Before moving into development, I spent over 10 years in product management, where I held senior and people management roles. That experience helps me build solutions that aren't just cool, but make sense.
